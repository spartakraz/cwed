Minimalist online C++ IDE for students. Using it students can write and test their C and C++ programs 
and code snippets at the programming lessons right over the Web without the need of installing heavyweight 
development systems on your desktop. Provides basic level of integration with GCC/G++,
GDB and Make.

Documentation is available from the DOCS directory. It was prepared in the GNU Nano
editor, using spaces instead of tabs and the value "4" as the tab width.
